This is a small course in getting to know Javascript better.
Basic Javascript knowledge is required. This course
will let you play around with new and old Javascript concepts.

Topic we will cover:

- How to start a simple Javascript playground from scratch?
- How to properly write Javascript tests?
- Working with functions, objects and classes
- Working with immutability
- Working with Arrays and loops
- Working with control flows
- Working with exceptions
- Working with promises
- Working with a lot of 'out-of-the-box' JS functions, like `Math`,
  `Regexp`
- Experimenting with JS, doing some measurements for performance, this
  should improve debugging skills and insights

Goal is to learn a lot of legacy AND modern JS through a series of
coding exercises focussing on the language, and later some architecture
steps, while learning TDD as well!
