# Learning TDD in javascript

How to start a simple JS playground from scratch?

How to properly write JS tests?

What kind of weird tricks has JS under the hood?

Learning modern js is cool and all that, but what about encountering all
kinds of 'old' js? how does that work?

Goal is to learn a lot of legacy AND modern JS through a series of
coding exercises focussing on the language, and later some architecture
steps, while learning TDD as well!
